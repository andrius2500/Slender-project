This project at first was supposed to be for fun slender-man based click and go game.
But during development i decided to make it as my portfolio game so that it would be more fun for people to find facts about me.
Game is simple, you need to find three pages with facts about me. If slender finds you first then game over.
Project is deployed with GH pages, here is the link for the game: https://andrius2500.github.io/Slender-project/
Have fun!

This project is done with React using React router 6 and SCSS.
There are some changes that needs to be done, like refactoring code, fixing some bugs, some style changes etc. Will keep updating this project!
